# Chennai's House Price Prediction

### Abstract

As the housing market in Chennai experiences continued growth, the need for reliable prediction models becomes imperative for accurate house price forecasts. The inherent unpredictability of housing markets presents a challenge for both buyers and sellers. In this project, we aim to develop a sophisticated house price prediction model by employing regression techniques and advanced feature selection methods to facilitate informed decision-making. The dataset utilized in this study encompasses various parameters, including the site location, square footage, number of bedrooms, amenities, and proximity to essential services. The relationship between individual parameters and house prices is established by identifying the most influential factors through feature selection techniques such as Feature Correlation, Mutual Information Regression,  LASSO regression, Boruta, and Sequential Feature Selection. To assess the model's efficacy, the machine-learning algorithm Random Forest Regression is employed. This comprehensive approach provides a robust tool for navigating Chennai's evolving housing landscape and making sound real estate decisions.
